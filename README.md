### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working with product development in a Norwegian online bank, and learning some web development on the side. 

## ðŸŒ± I learned the fundamentals of how the web works
- How HTML, CSS and Javascript make up a website
- Server side and client make up the front and back end
- Website hosting

## ðŸŒ± I took quite some time to learn vanilla Javascript (up to ES6)
- modules
- new array methods
- NodeJS, including REST-API setup with Express
- Server-side rendered apps with RESTful routing (MERN stack)
- Single page applications with AJAX (MERN stack)

## ðŸŒ± Now I am finally learning a modern JS framework: React
- Using JSX to create web apps inside a single index.html file.
- Class components and state/prop propagation.
- Creating web apps bootstrapped with 'create-react-app'.
- Functional components with React hooks such as useState and useContext.
- Single page application routing (urls) with 'react-router'
- ... and more to come
