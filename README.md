### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working with product development in a Norwegian online bank, and learning some web development on the side. 

## ðŸŒ± I learned the fundamentals of how the web works
- HTML, CSS and Javascript make up a website,
- how server side and client make up the front and back end
- intro to SQL and no-SQL databases
- basic tools like git, command line etc.

## âœ¨ I took quite some time to learn vanilla Javascript (up to ES6)
- ES6 modules,
- new array methods,
- setting up Node REST-APIs with Express,
- server-side rendered pages with RESTful routing (MERN stack),
- single page applications with AJAX (MERN stack),

## ðŸ”­ Now I am finally learning a modern JS framework: React
- Using JSX to create web apps inside a single index.html file,
- class components and state/prop propagation,
- creating single page application (SPA) bootstrapped with 'create-react-app',
- functional components with the most common React hooks such as useState and useContext,
- SPA routing and url-manipulation with 'react-router',
- ... and lots more to come
